1. PREAMBLE
   The TimiGS project was created to provide a transparent, efficient, and privacy-focused activity tracker. The goal of this license is to ensure that the software remains open and free for everyone to inspect, learn from, and improve, while strictly protecting the identity, reputation, and branding of the original project. We believe in open source, but we also believe in credit where credit is due and preventing confusion for end-users.
