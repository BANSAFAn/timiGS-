3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "TimiGS Integration")
4. Set an expiration date (recommended: 90 days or No expiration for convenience)
5. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
   - `read:user` - Read user profile data
   - `user:email` - Access user email addresses
6. Click **Generate token**
7. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep your Personal Access Token secure! It provides access to your GitHub account. Never share it publicly or commit it to a repository.

### Connecting to TimiGS

1. Open TimiGS and navigate to the **GitHub** page
2. Paste your Personal Access Token in the input field
3. Click **Connect GitHub**

## Security & Privacy

### Token Storage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Your GitHub token NEVER leaves your device.** It's stored in browser localStorage and used only for direct API calls to GitHub. TimiGS has no backend server that could intercept or store your token.

**Implementation Code:**

```typescript
// Github.vue - Token storage (local only)
async function connectGitHub() {
  if (!githubToken.value) return;
  
  // Direct API call to GitHub - no intermediary
  const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/user", {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${githubToken.value}` }
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    githubUser.value = await response.json();
    // Store token in localStorage ONLY - never sent to TimiGS
    localStorage.setItem("github_token", githubToken.value);
    isConnected.value = true;
  }
}

// Disconnect - removes from localStorage
function disconnectGitHub() {
  localStorage.removeItem("github_token");
  githubToken.value = "";
  githubUser.value = null;
  events.value = [];
  isConnected.value = false;
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. You paste your token into the input field
2. Token is stored in browser's localStorage
3. All GitHub API requests include this token
4. Requests go **directly** from your browser to `api.github.com`
5. TimiGS code runs in your browser - no server involved

- ✅ Tokens stored in browser localStorage only
- ✅ Tokens never sent to TimiGS servers (there are none!)
- ✅ All API calls go directly from your browser to GitHub
- ✅ You can disconnect and clear token at any time

### Token Permissions

The requested token scopes allow TimiGS to:
- ✅ Read your public and private repository information
- ✅ Read your user profile
- ✅ Read your activity events
- ❌ **Cannot** push code or make changes to repositories
- ❌ **Cannot** delete repositories
- ❌ **Cannot** modify organization settings

**API Calls Made (All Direct to GitHub):**

```typescript
// Fetch user profile
const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/user", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${githubToken.value}` }
});

// Fetch repositories
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos?sort=updated&per_page=20`,
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${githubToken.value}` } }
);

// Fetch activity events
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.github.com/users/${username}/events?per_page=20`,
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${githubToken.value}` } }
);
```

**Network Traffic Analysis:**
- Open DevTools → Network tab
- You'll see requests ONLY to `api.github.com`
- No requests to TimiGS servers
- Your token is in request headers, visible only to GitHub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TimiGS only reads data from GitHub. It cannot make changes to your repositories, issues, or pull requests.

### Revoking Access

To revoke TimiGS access to your GitHub account:

**Method 1: From TimiGS**
1. Go to the GitHub page in TimiGS
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Your token is removed from localStorage

**Method 2: From GitHub**
1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Find the TimiGS token
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

## API Details

### GitHub REST API

TimiGS uses the **GitHub REST API v3** for all operations:

**Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /user` - Fetch authenticated user profile
- `GET /users/{username}/repos` - List user repositories
- `GET /users/{username}/events` - List user activity events

### Rate Limits

GitHub API has rate limits for authenticated requests:
- **5,000 requests per hour** for authenticated users
- **60 requests per hour** for unauthenticated users

> [!NOTE]
> TimiGS uses very few API calls. Typical usage:
> - 1 call to load user profile
> - 1 call to load repositories
> - 1 call to load activity (refreshed manually)
> 
> You're unlikely to hit rate limits under normal usage.

### Checking Rate Limit

If you're concerned about rate limits, you can check your current usage:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Look for GitHub API responses
4. Check the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid token" Error

If you see this error:
1. Verify you copied the entire token
2. Check that the token hasn't expired
3. Ensure the token has the required scopes (`repo`, `read:user`, `user:email`)
4. Generate a new token if needed

### No Repositories Showing

If your repositories don't appear:
1. Check that you have repositories on GitHub
2. Verify the token has `repo` scope
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check browser console for errors

### Activity Feed Empty

If no activity appears:
1. Verify you have recent GitHub activity
2. Check that the token is still valid
3. Click the Refresh button
4. Check your internet connection

### Connection Lost

If the connection is lost:
1. Check if your token was revoked on GitHub
2. Verify internet connectivity
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
4. Generate a new token if the old one expired

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> **Token Expiration** - Set a reasonable expiration date for your token (e.g., 90 days) and create a calendar reminder to renew it before it expires.

> [!TIP]
> **Minimal Scopes** - Only grant the scopes TimiGS needs. Don't add extra permissions like `delete_repo` or `admin:org`.

> [!TIP]
> **Regular Monitoring** - Check your GitHub activity feed in TimiGS regularly to stay on top of your coding patterns and productivity.

> [!TIP]
> **Correlation Analysis** - Use the GitHub integration alongside activity tracking to see how coding sessions correlate with other work activities.

## Privacy Considerations

> [!NOTE]
> **Local Processing** - All GitHub data is fetched directly from GitHub's API to your browser. TimiGS servers never see your GitHub data or token.

> [!NOTE]
> **No Data Storage** - GitHub activity is not stored in TimiGS database. It's fetched fresh each time you view the GitHub page.

> [!NOTE]
> **Token Security** - Your Personal Access Token is stored in browser localStorage. Clear your browser data if you're on a shared computer.

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Accounts

Currently, TimiGS supports one GitHub account at a time. To switch accounts:
1. Disconnect the current account
2. Generate a token for the new account
3. Connect with the new token

### Organization Repositories

If you have access to organization repositories:
- They will appear in your repository list
- Activity from organization repos appears in your feed
- Ensure your token has access to the organization

### Private Repository Access

To track activity on private repositories:
- Ensure your token has the `repo` scope (not just `public_repo`)
- Private repos will appear alongside public ones
- Activity from private repos is included in your feed

## Coding Activity Insights
