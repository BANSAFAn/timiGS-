# 🛠️ Developer Notes

## Current Status

At the moment, I've fixed a lot of things, but new problems have emerged in their place. However, in upcoming versions, I want to implement:

- **Table support**
- **Synchronization between tables**

---

## Tools & Organization

I need to work separately on the tools section. Instead of having everything in one big mess, I'll create a **dedicated tab** where users can easily find what they need.

---

## Website Plans

I'll also start working on the global part — the first website will be **Alternative.net** (or something similar in that domain space). I don't quite remember the exact name, but maybe people will like it thanks to the design. Although right now, I'm fully focused on the **backend part**.

---

## Android Version

Perhaps I should also work on the **Android version**, but I haven't had the chance to get to it yet. I just can't seem to find the time to tackle this feature. But if needed, I'll take it on — translate, fix, and resolve any issues that come up.

---

## Application Size

I might also be able to **compress the application**. Currently, it weighs **72 MB**, although I planned for a minimum of **20 MB**. The problem is the **music files**. 

> Possibly, I'll just upload it to the website and let people decide for themselves whether to download it or not.

---

## Future Learning

I'm probably going to start studying **Go (Golang)** and consider transitioning to it. There's a lot of buzz around it lately, which is very interesting.
